# Data-Visualisation-for-Sales-Dataset using Power BI-

Visualizing Data is a very important part of interpreting what the data is about and what it is trying
to portray. As it is the age of Big Data now, visualization of data is the most common and used tool
to make interpretations of data which has billions of rows generated all the time.  

The dataset which I have chosen is the Number of Sales Generated in different states of the
United States of America using different variables which are Payment Methods of
customers, amount of sales, number of units sold, Discount offered, Cost of Goods sold, Zip
code of stores, Product type etc.
Using Sales Domain as a preferred dataset is considered a good choice as a good
visualization of a sales dataset can help Marketers and the Customers in a very broad way.
As sales reports provide an insight into how a business is performing and its market position,
Sales Managers use it to analyse how the company is doing and helps in developing
strategies to improve the market position of the company. 

Visualization Techniques Used:
Clustered Bar Chart 
Line and Clustered Columns 
Map 
Waterfall Chart 
Pie Chart 

I had to face a few challenges while visualizing this data as the data set was very vast
and complex. It had many false and null values which had to rectified before actually
visualizing the data. Datasets were combined to get better details of the whole data in
order to visualize. It was concluded that the Tyrone Smyth was the manager who had
the most contribution in the companyâ€™s Gross Profit.
The product with the most sales and profit ratio was Quad at a profit of almost 1Million
Euros and Fun Fly was the product with the least profit contribution. This insight can
help the Business Managers to make decisions about the products the company should
manufacture and at what scale. The company took payments for the products offered in
various ways. The most profitable payment method for the company was Visa as it had
resulted in the maximum Gross Profit.
These were the insights the company could use to make important changes in the
company to make sure the company keeps generating profits while providing maximum
customer satisfaction
